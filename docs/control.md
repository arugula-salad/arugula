# illogical control

illogical control lets you reach your machines from any device without a
tailnet. It is also where accounts and devices live. The hosted one is at
<https://control.illogical.widgets.wtf>; you can run your own from this
repository (below).

**What it can and can't see.**

- **It sees:** who you are, which devices and machines you have, and when
  they connect.
- **It never sees what your terminals say.** Every connection between a
  device and a machine is end-to-end encrypted, including connections it
  relays.
- **It can't add a device that reads them:**
  - every device and machine is approved by a device you already have;
  - your devices and machines check those approvals themselves.

The design is in [control-e2e.md](control-e2e.md). Teams, roles, personal
vs team machines and sharing a session:
[Your machines, your team](teams.md).

## Using it

1. **Sign in** at control's page, with GitHub or a passkey (a passkey can
   also make an account by itself).
   - The first browser you use becomes your account's first device.
   - It shows two **recovery codes** once. Keep them offline: if you lose
     every device, one of them lets a new browser in, once. *Devices and
     machines…* says how many are left; *Make new codes* there replaces
     them (the old ones stop working).
2. **Add a machine.** Install illogical on it, then run:

   ```
   illogicald join https://control.illogical.widgets.wtf
   ```

   It prints a link with a code (good for 15 minutes). Open it on a
   signed-in device, check the code matches, and approve. *Join to* picks
   your account (*Just me*) or a team you own; `--team ID` picks the team
   ahead. *Cancel* turns it down. A running daemon connects within a few
   seconds, and the machine appears in the host menu.
3. **Add your phone** (or any other browser): *Add a phone or browser…* in
   the host menu shows control's address as a QR code and a link. Sign in
   there. It shows a fingerprint and waits. Your devices ask *New device?*
   with the same fingerprint; approve it on one of them.
4. **Remove a device or machine** from *Devices and machines…* in the host
   menu. It loses access at once. A removed machine keeps running
   illogical, reachable only locally; `illogicald join` adds it back.

**How a device reaches a machine:**

- **Directly, when it can.** The machine's tailnet name, or any
  `--direct-url` the daemon was given.
- **Otherwise through control's relay.** The host menu says which:
  "direct" or "relayed".
- Chrome asks once for permission to reach your local network when a
  machine has a tailnet or LAN address. Without that permission, it uses
  the relay.

**Leaving.** `illogicald leave` takes a machine off your account (or its
team). illogical keeps running there, at `http://127.0.0.1:7681`.

**Your sign-ins, and deleting your account:** *Sign-in and account…* in
the host menu.

- **Where you're signed in:** each session, by browser and when it
  started. *Sign out* ends one; *Sign out everywhere* ends them all, this
  one too. Signing out doesn't remove a device: its key still reaches your
  machines until you remove it in *Devices and machines…*. Expired
  sessions are deleted within the hour.
- **Passkeys:** remove one, as long as another way to sign in is left
  (another passkey, or GitHub).
- **Delete account…** asks you to type your GitHub login (or your name,
  for a passkey-only account). Control then deletes your account, its
  GitHub link, sessions, passkeys, devices and machines (they're refused
  from then on; illogical keeps running on them, reachable only locally),
  pending joins, push subscriptions, hosted VMs (deleted), usage counts,
  team requests and the invites you made. Your open relay connections
  close.
  - **A team you founded is deleted with it.** Its signed history starts
    at your first device's key, so it can't outlive your account. Its
    other members are told; its machines go back to their owners.
  - **In someone else's team** as a plain member, you can delete right
    away: the roster keeps your name, with no device behind it (so it
    lets nothing in), until an owner removes it. Its owners are told.
  - **As an owner of someone else's team**, or if your devices ever signed
    its roster, leave it first (make someone else an owner if it's only
    you). If your devices signed part of its history, control keeps those
    devices' certificates (public keys and device names, nothing else) to
    check that history, until the team is deleted.
  - **Paying for a plan?** Cancel it first.
  - The hosted control's backups keep a deleted account for up to a week
    more (see below).

**Moving a machine** between your account and a team (or between teams):
*Move to…* on it in *Devices and machines…*. You need to own the teams on
both sides. Your device signs the move and the machine checks that
signature, so control can't move a machine by itself. An offline machine
moves when it next connects.

**What isn't here yet:** the CLI (`illogical`) still reaches only the local
daemon, or others over the tailnet.

## Running your own

`illogical-control` is one static binary with an SQLite database. Put TLS
in front of it: Caddy, Fly, or `tailscale serve`.

```
illogical-control --public-url https://control.example.com --listen 127.0.0.1:7690 --db /var/lib/illogical/control.db
```

- **Sign-in:**
  - **Passkeys** work whenever control has a domain name (WebAuthn refuses
    IP addresses).
  - **GitHub**: register a GitHub App (or OAuth app) with the callback
    `https://control.example.com/auth/github/callback`, then set
    `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **The GitHub App** (M40, optional): forge blocks' live updates from
  GitHub, and read access for hosted boxes with no `gh` login. Make it
  with GitHub's manifest flow (or by hand at *Settings → Developer settings
  → GitHub Apps*):
  - **Permissions**, all read-only: metadata, contents, pull requests,
    issues, checks, commit statuses, actions.
  - **Events:** pull request, pull request review, pull request review
    comment, issues, issue comment, check run, check suite, status,
    workflow run.
  - **Webhook URL** `https://control.example.com/github/webhook`, with a
    secret. **Callback URL** `https://control.example.com/auth/github/callback`
    if it also signs people in.
  - Install it on the accounts (or organizations) whose repositories you
    want live, then give control its id, slug, client id and secret,
    webhook secret and private key: `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`,
    `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`,
    `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` (a
    `.pem` path) or `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (the PEM itself; `\n` for
    newlines works). On Fly:
    `fly secrets set GITHUB_APP_ID=… GITHUB_APP_SLUG=… GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=… GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=… GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=… GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat app.pem)"`.
  - With no `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`/`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, the App's client id
    and secret sign people in with GitHub.
  - **What control keeps of a webhook:** the signature is checked
    (HMAC-SHA256, constant time), the delivery id deduplicated, and only
    `{provider, host, repo, number?, event, delivery}` goes to daemons,
    over their relay sockets. Its log has the event, delivery, repository
    and how many daemons heard; never the payload.
  - **Who hears what:** a daemon's account must have signed in with GitHub,
    and the App's installation for the repository must be that GitHub
    user's, or GitHub must list them as a collaborator on it (asked with
    an installation token; answers kept ten minutes). Organization
    membership alone doesn't count, and passkey-only accounts hear
    nothing: their blocks poll.
  - **Hosted boxes** ask `POST /api/daemon/github/token {repo}` (signed as
    the daemon) for an installation token scoped to that repository with
    read-only permissions; control keeps one until five minutes before it
    expires.
- **Behind a proxy** that passes the client's address in a header, use
  `--trust-proxy-header` (for example `Fly-Client-IP`), so rate limits are
  per client.
- **Build it** with `just static` (`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/illogical-control`).
  - The web client is built into the binary.
  - `--static-dir web/dist` serves a local build instead.
- **The hosted one** is `packaging/control/` on Fly: `just control-deploy`.

- **Relay limits per account**, so one account can't take the whole
  machine (0 turns each off):
  - `ILLOGICAL_RELAY_MAX_SOCKETS` (32): client connections through the
    relay at once (a page uses one for all its machines).
  - `ILLOGICAL_RELAY_MAX_MACHINES` (50): machines dialed in at once.
  - `ILLOGICAL_RELAY_DAILY_MB` (2000): relayed traffic a day, while
    billing is off. Past it the account's relayed traffic slows to about
    64 KB/s, as billing's allowance does. Direct connections don't count.
- **Backups:** set `LITESTREAM_BUCKET` and control backs its database up
  continuously with Litestream (below).

Daemons join a self-hosted control the same way:
`illogicald join https://control.example.com`.

## Operating the hosted one

The hosted control is one Fly machine (`packaging/control/fly.toml`):
`shared-cpu-1x` with 1 GB, in `ewr`, SQLite on the `control_data` volume.

**Capacity.** An idle relay connection costs control about 28 KB: in a
1 GB VM, 3,900 of them took 121 MB. So the connection limits in
`fly.toml` (6,000 soft, 8,000 hard) are about open files, not memory.
Control raises its open-file limit to the hard one at start and logs it
(`open file limit open_files=…` in `fly logs`); keep `hard_limit` below
that. Each account is held to the relay limits above.

**Backups (Litestream to Cloudflare R2).** Off until its secrets are set;
then:

- on start, with no database on the volume (a new or lost volume),
  control restores the latest backup first. If the bucket can't be
  reached it doesn't start, rather than start empty;
- it runs `litestream replicate` beside itself (in the image at
  `/litestream`): changes reach R2 within about a second. A snapshot a
  day, each kept 7 days, so a point-in-time restore reaches back a week,
  and anything deleted is gone from the backup within a week;
- on a stop it lets Litestream sync one last time.

To turn it on:

1. In Cloudflare: *R2 → Create bucket* (say `illogical-control-backup`,
   automatic location). Then *R2 → Manage API tokens → Create API token*:
   *Object Read & Write*, for that bucket only. Note the access key id,
   the secret, and the S3 endpoint
   (`https://<account id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`).
2. Set the secrets (Fly restarts the machine with them):

   ```
   fly secrets set -a illogical-control \
     LITESTREAM_BUCKET=illogical-control-backup \
     LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT=https://<account id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
     LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID=… LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=…
   ```

   `LITESTREAM_PATH` (default `control`) is the prefix in the bucket;
   `LITESTREAM_REGION` defaults to `auto`.
3. Check `fly logs`: `backing up with Litestream`, then Litestream's own
   `replicating to` and `snapshot complete` lines.

**Restoring.**

- **Onto a new volume:** create it (`fly volumes create control_data -r ewr
  -s 1`), point the machine at it (or destroy the old volume), and start
  the machine. Control finds no database and restores the latest backup.
- **To look at a backup, or go back in time,** on any machine with
  `litestream` and the same four values in its environment:

  ```
  cat > ls.yml <<EOF
  dbs:
    - path: /tmp/control.db
      replica: {type: s3, bucket: illogical-control-backup, path: control, region: auto, endpoint: "https://<account id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", force-path-style: true}
  EOF
  LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID=… LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=… litestream restore -config ls.yml -o /tmp/control.db /tmp/control.db
  ```

  Add `-timestamp 2026-10-04T12:00:00Z` for a point in time. To put it
  back: stop the machine, copy the file over `/data/control.db` (and
  delete `control.db-wal`, `control.db-shm` and `.control.db-litestream`
  beside it), start it.
- **Restored once to prove it** (2026-10-04, staging): a control in one VM
  replicated to an S3-compatible store in another; the VM was destroyed;
  a fresh VM with an empty disk restored on start, and every account,
  device and machine was there, and replication carried on.

Fly's own daily volume snapshots (kept 5 days) still run.

**A spend alert** isn't something this repository sets: it belongs to
the Fly organization's billing settings in Fly's dashboard (#174 leaves
it to Jake).

## Testing

- `just control-smoke` runs it end to end without a browser:
  - a fake GitHub sign-in, then enrolment and approval;
  - a daemon joining by code;
  - its API and protocol through the relay and directly;
  - a check that control's wire traffic, database and logs never contain
    what was typed;
  - deleting an account: its machine is refused, and no row in the
    database mentions it.
- `web/e2e/control.spec.ts` and `web/e2e/passkey.spec.ts` drive it in Chrome.
- `web/e2e/device-keys.webkit.spec.ts` drives it in Playwright's WebKit
  (`pnpm exec playwright install webkit` first): device keys survive a
  reload, a join is approved from a later page load, and a browser that
  lost its key enrolls again.
- **Safari itself:** open `/key-probe.html` on control (or any daemon) in
  Safari. It stores a set of device keys, reloads, and says whether they
  still work, and which Safari it is.
- Control logs every refused enrolment and approval (`refused`, with the
  request, the reason, and the account, device and approver ids; never a
  signature or a body), so `fly logs` shows why.
