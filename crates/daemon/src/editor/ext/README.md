# Arugula for VS Code and Cursor

Puts your editor in your [Arugula](https://arugula.io) swarm, beside your terminals and agents.

- **It joins when you ask.** Run *arugula: Show this workspace in the swarm*. It's remembered for the folder; *Take this workspace out of the swarm* removes it at once.
- **Others see where you are.** The swarm shows the editor as a tile in its project, with the file you're in, the lines around your cursor, errors and unsaved files.
- **Following.** Anyone you let see the machine can follow your cursor across files, read-only, from a browser or a phone. The status bar says when someone is following.
- **Things that need you go on the rail.** The debugger stopping at a breakpoint (with Continue), errors after a save, and a merge conflict.
- **Remote-SSH and dev containers.** The extension runs where the files are and talks to the Arugula daemon on that machine. In a dev container, mount the daemon's state directory (the Arugula dev container feature does).

It talks only to the Arugula daemon on its own machine, over a local socket. Your files and cursor go only to the people following you, over Arugula's end-to-end channels.

It also brings Arugula's colour theme.
