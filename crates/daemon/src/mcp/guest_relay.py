# The guest end of a VM agent's MCP relay (#59). The daemon runs it as a
# non-TTY exec in the agent's VM (`python3 -c THIS arugula-mcp-relay
# SOCKET`): it listens on SOCKET and carries every connection over the
# exec's stdin and stdout, one line each way per message:
#
#   N+         connection N opened        (guest to host)
#   N:LINE     a line for connection N    (both ways)
#   N-         connection N closed        (both ways)
#
# The host serves each connection as its own MCP session, so an agent that
# restarts its MCP client just connects again. A newer relay for the same
# socket (the daemon restarted) replaces this one.
