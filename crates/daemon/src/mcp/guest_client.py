# What a VM agent runs as its `arugula` MCP server (#59): stdio MCP,
# carried to the relay's Unix socket (`guest_relay.py`) and from there to
# the daemon. `python3 -c THIS arugula-mcp SOCKET`.
#
# The relay comes and goes (it starts beside the agent, and a restarted
# daemon starts a new one), so this waits for the socket, and when the
# connection drops it connects again and replays the client's
# `initialize`. Requests that were in flight get an error saying to call
# again.
