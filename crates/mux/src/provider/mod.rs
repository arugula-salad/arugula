//! Sandbox providers (M4b): whoever runs the machines that aren't this
//! host, behind one trait. The first adapter is the Sprites API
//! (`labs/sprites.rs`), which covers wisp here on geek and Fly's hosted sprites.
//!
//! A provider can:
//!
//! - **list** its sandboxes and say what state each is in (`running`,
//!   `warm`, `cold`), from its API: asking never wakes a sandbox;
//! - **create**, **delete** and **wake** one;
//! - open a **byte stream** to a port inside one (the Sprites proxy): how a
//!   browser block reaches a dev server, and how the home daemon reaches a
//!   resident daemon's port (the provider tunnel);
//! - run an **exec TTY** (create, attach, resize, kill): VM panes, and a
//!   shell on a sandbox with no daemon in it;
//! - run a non-TTY exec with pipes (agent servers in VMs), and a command to
//!   completion;
//! - optionally write files and keep a **service** running (start on boot,
//!   restart on exit): how a daemon becomes resident;
//! - optionally **browse files** (M7, [`Caps::fs_browse`]): list a
//!   directory and read part of a file, which is how the picker and `fs`
//!   reach a machine with no daemon of ours in it.
//!
//! **Differences are capabilities, not assumptions** ([`Caps`]). S4 found
//! two "compatible" implementations differ in how much exec output they
//! replay, who owns a reattached session, how a kill behaves and what
//! "cold" means; code asks instead of assuming wisp.
//!
//! The trait and its types stay in core, as the interface; the Sprites
//! adapter and what runs on it are Labs (`labs/`). A build without Labs has
//! no adapter, so none of this is ever used there.
